   Derived from Clojure but with a few differences. Supports immutable, persistent
   collections.

2. Is there a stable version? **Sort of**

   1.8.40 is described as a "stable release" but it's nothing more than the latest
   cut from master. The numbering aligns with the Clojure version.

3. Is it under active development? **Yes**

   The latest version was released in March 2016. The number of commits has
   dropped in recent months.

4. What is its [bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor)? **Small**

   Development relies pretty heavily on the work of
   [David Nolen](https://github.com/swannodette) but it was originally created
   by Rich Hickey and is supported by the Clojure/core team.
